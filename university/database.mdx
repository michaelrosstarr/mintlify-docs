# Connection table

Using DynamoDB, we need to store connection info of the player.

The entry gets created when the player connects to the web socket for the first time. We need to bind the `gameID` and `playerID`. The reason for this, is that if the player gets disconnected for whatever reason, they can reconnect and we simply just update the connectionId with the `playerID` and `gameID`. We will just have a function that the client has to call to valdiate their information against the connectionst table.
