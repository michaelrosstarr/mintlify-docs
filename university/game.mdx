# Setting Up a Host Account
### New Host
Individuals who wish to create games have to sign in into the application to be granted *Host* privileges. In order to be granted *Host* privileges, navigate to [taxga.me](https://www.taxga.me/login) and sign in using a Google Account of your choice.

### Returning Host
Individuals who have already signed in can navigate to the [same page](https://www.taxga.me/login) and click on the *Continue As* button.

For individuals who are already signed in but want to sign in using a different account, you can navigate to the [same page](https://www.taxga.me/login) and click on the *Sign Out* button and sign back in using another account.

Located on this this dashboard are all the parameters that can be tuned for different games and can be modified according to preference. If you want any of the options to be reverted to their default state then click the *Reset Defaults* button in the top right hand corner of the dashboard.

On this dashboard, you can provide a custom description for a specific game. This description will be used as an identifier to help select a specific game in order to extract the data from.

After settling on all the options for a game, you can save them in case you want to reuse the same option settings for future games by click on the *Save Options* button. 

Once all the options have been finalised and/or saved, you can start a new game by clicking on the *Create Game* button. Once a game has been created, there will be a QR code that players can scan to join your newly-created game. Alternatively, there will also be a link underneath the QR code that you can copy and redistribute to players.

# Running the Game
In order to start a game, a minimum of one player needs to join. Once this minimum player count has been reached, you can start the game.

- The countdown in each stage
- The leaderboard
