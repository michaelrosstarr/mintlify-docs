* Values determined by the Server Stack are referred to as `[from METHOD /endpoint]`
* Values determined by the player are referred to as `[from client]`

## createGame
createGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `${gameID}`. It also creates the first empty planet in the planets array (in the elasticache-tax-game cache with the key `planets`).

### Required data
```
action: "game",
type: "createGame",
gameID: [from POST /createGame] //string
stageTime: [from client] //in seconds (eg: 20 = 20s | so a round will be 1m 20s)
auditChance: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
finePercent: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
pcm: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 1.7) | planet collection multiplier
defaultRate: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"createGame","gameID":"game-c3b4i7ybc","stageTime":20,"auditChance":0.25,"finePercent":0.15,"pcm":1.7,"defaultRate":0.30}`

### Elasticache
```
${gameID}: {
    hostID: connectionID,
    gameID: data.gameID,
    gameConfiguration: {
        stageTime: data.stageTime,
        auditChance: data.auditChance,
        finePercent: data.finePercent,
        pcm: data.pcm,
        defaultRate: data.defaultRate,
      }
}

planets :[
  {
      planetID: "planet0",
      name: "planet0",
      players: [{
        connectionID: connectionID,
        role: ["A" || "B" || "C"]
    }],
  },
]
```

### Returns

```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `["OK","OK"]`
```

## joinGame
joinGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `${gameID}---${playerID}`. It will return a generated role and planet to each connection (once the planet is established), and update the host with the new player (playerID and name).

<Warning>When WebSockets receives the request, it scans `DynamoDBStack-WebsocketConnections87C62C57-1H8H09K1YWXHY` table. If there is a record in the table with the same connectionId & gameID, it gets that object from Elasticache and returns the full item to the user.</Warning>

### Required data
```
action: "game",
type: "joinGame",
gameID: [from client] //string
playerID: [from POST /joinGame] //string
name: [from client] //string
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"joinGame","gameID":"game-c3b4i7ybc","playerID":"001a","name":"Emma"}`

### New Connection

#### Role A
```
${gameID}---${playerID}: {
    connectionId: connectionID,
    playerID: data.playerID,
    name: data.name,
    role: "A", //
    wealth: [0],
    rank: [0],
    planet: `${planetID},${planetName}`, // 
    taxRate: [], // ONLY A
    redistributedWealth: [], // ONLY A | amount they redistributed to B and C players in a round
    playerCount: [], // ONLY A | number of players on the planet they are currently on (relevant for redistribution calculations & planet stats)
    bankrupt: [], // - true if they went bankrupt in a round
}
```

#### Role B
```
${gameID}---${playerID}: {

    connectionId: connectionID,
    playerID: data.playerID,
    name: data.name,
    role: "B", //
    wealth: [0],
    rank: [0],
    planet: `${planetID},${planetName}`,
    income: [0], // - income they recieve in a round
    declaredIncome: [0], // - income they declared in a round
    audit: [0], // - amount they were fined in an audit in a round
    bankrupt: [], // - true if they went bankrupt in a round
}
```

#### Role C
```
${gameID}---${playerID}: {

    connectionId: connectionID,
    playerID: data.playerID,
    name: data.name,
    role: "C", //
    wealth: [0],
    rank: [0],
    planet: [`${planetID},${planetName}`], //only an array for role C
    income: [0], // - income they recieve in a round
    declaredIncome: [0], // - income they declared in a round
    audit: [0], // - amount they were fined in an audit in a round
    bankrupt: [], // - true if they went bankrupt in a round
}
```

#### Returns
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `host [${hostID}] alerted of player [${name}] `
```

<Note>Each time a player sends a joinGame request, the host will receive the following string: `{"message":{"playerID":"001a","playerName":"Emma", "type":"[new|rejoin]"}}`</Note>

### Existing Connection
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "{\"connectionId\":\"Zg2C4e7uliACEsg= \",\"playerID\":\"00001 \",\"name\":\"Emma \",\"role\":\"A\",\"wealth\":[0],\"rank\":[0],\"planet\":\"planet1,Quintaris\",\"taxRate\":[],\"redistributedWealth\":[],\"playerCount\":[],\"bankrupt\":[]}"
```

## startGame
startGame goes through all of the planets in the elasticache-tax-game cache, ensures that there are no planets with an awkward amount of players (checks the last planet), and then sends each player their planet (name and ID) and role.

* If there are two or less players, startGame reassigns each of them to an existing planet with the "B" role
    * The existing planets are determined by the player's position in the player array: `planetsObject[newestPlanet.players.indexOf(player)].players.push`

### Required data
```
action: "game",
type: "startGame",
gameID: [from POST /createGame] //string
```

### Each player receives:
`{"message":{"planetID":"planet1","planet_name":"Soralia","playerRole":"C"}}
`

## startRound
It should be sent by the **Host**. Creates an array of items in `DynamoDBStack-WebsocketConnections87C62C57-1H8H09K1YWXHY` with the given gameID, and then sends each connection the response message.

### Required data
```
action: "game",
type: "startRound",
gameID: string,
round: number
```

### Returns
#### To Host
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `{"round":1,"stage":1,"stageStartTime":"2024-06-17T18:17:49.544Z","stageDuration":20}`
```

#### To Players
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `{"message":{"round":1,"stage":1,"stageStartTime":"2024-06-17T17:48:58.380Z","stageDuration":20}}`
```

## handleStage
Handle stage is sent by a player that needed to make an action during that stage:
- At the end of stage 1, all "A" players should send a handleStage request
- At the end of stage 2, all "B" and "C" players should send a handleStage request
- At the end of stage 3, **all** players should send a handleStage request
- At the end of stage 4, "C" players should send a handleStage request

<Warning>The WebSockets don't check if the stage duration is up. For stage 1 and stage 4, responses will be sent per player. For stage 2 and stage 3, responses will be send when the whole planet has responded.</Warning>
