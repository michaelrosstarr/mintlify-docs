This is an explanation of the data that needs to be sent to the WebSocket connection to execute a given function. For each function, you can find the data structure and an example of a working command.

### createGame
CreateGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `game`. It also creates the first empty planet in the planets array (in the elasticache-tax-game cache with the key `planets`).

#### Required data
```
action: "game",
type: "createGame",
gameID: string, from RestAPI
stageTime: in seconds (eg: 20 = 20s | so a round will be 1m 20s)
auditChance: number, decimal
finePercent: number, decimal
pcm: number, decimal | planet collection multiplier
defaultRate: number, decimal
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"createGame","gameID":"game-c3b4i7ybc","stageTime":20,"auditChance":0.25,"finePercent":0.15,"pcm":1.7,"defaultRate":0.30}`

#### Result
```
game: {
    hostID: connectionID,
    gameID: data.gameID,
    gameConfiguration: {
    stageTime: data.stageTime,
    auditChance: data.auditChance,
    finePercent: data.finePercent,
    pcm: data.pcm,
    defaultRate: data.defaultRate,
  }
}

planets :[
  {
      planetID: "planet0",
      name: "planet0",
      players: [],
  },
]
```
