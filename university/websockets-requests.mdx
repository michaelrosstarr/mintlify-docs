## WebSocket Documentation
* Values determined by the Server Stack are referred to as `[from METHOD /endpoint]`
* Values determined by the player are referred to as `[from client]`
* [Send requests](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ws?ref=blog.krum.io) to: `wss://w1ws57hjh0.execute-api.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/prod/`

<Note>If at any point you need to see what a given player's object looks like, you can always send this query: `{"action":"check","type":"redis","method":"player","pid":"00001","gid":"18062024-2210"}` where pid is playerID and gid is gameID.</Note>

## createGame
createGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `${gameID}`. It also creates the first empty planet in the planets array (in the elasticache-tax-game cache with the key `planets`).

### Required data
```javascript
{
    action: string, //MUST BE "game"
    type: string, //MUST BE "createGame"
    gameID: string, //[from RestAPI]
    stageTime: number, //in seconds (eg: 20 = 20s | so a round will be 1m 20s)
    auditChance: number, //decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
    finePercent: number, //decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
    planetCollectionMultiplier: number, //decimal (eg: 1.7) | planet collection multiplier
    taxRate: number, //decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
    declaredIncomePercent: number,
    incomeMax: number,
    incomeMin: number,
    bankruptcyThreshold: number,
    generateNewIncomeEachRound: boolean
}
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"createGame","gameID":"18062024-1845","stageTime":20,"auditChance":0.25,"finePercent":0.15,"planetCollectionMultiplier":1.7,"taxRate":0.30, "declaredIncomePercent": 0.40, "incomeMax":1200, "incomeMin":600, "bankruptcyThreshold": 0, "generateNewIncomeEachRound": false}`

### Elasticache
```javascript
`${gameID}`: {
    hostID: string,
    gameID: string,
    gameConfiguration: {
        stageTime: number,
        auditChance: number,
        finePercent: number,
        pcm: number,
        defaultRate: number,
        decIP: number,
        incomeMax: number,
        incomeMin: number,
        bankruptcyThreshold: number,
        gNIEC: boolean
      }
}

`${planetID}-${gameID}`: {
    planetID: "planet1",
    planetName: `${AI generated}`,
    taxRate: data.taxRate,
    players: [{
        connectionID: string, //player's connection id
        playerID: string,
        playerName: string,
        role: string // one of ["A" || "B" || "C"]
    }],
  };

`planets-${gameID}` : "1";
```

### Returns

```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `{"type":"createGame","message":["OK","OK","OK","OK","OK","OK"]}`
```

## joinGame
joinGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `${gameID}---${playerID}`. It will return a generated role and planet to each connection (once the planet is established), and update the host with the new player (playerID and name).

<Note> When WebSockets receives the request, it scans `DynamoDBStack-WebsocketConnections87C62C57-1H8H09K1YWXHY` table. If there is a record in the table with the same connectionId & gameID, it gets that object from Elasticache and returns the full item to the user.</Note>

### Required data
```javascript
action: string, //MUST BE "game"
type: string, //MUST BE "joinGame"
gameID: string,
playerID: string, //from RestAPI [ POST /joinGame]
name: string //from client
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"joinGame","gameID":"game-c3b4i7ybc","playerID":"001a","name":"Emma"}`

### New Connection
#### Elasticache: Role A
```javascript
`${gameID}---${playerID}`: {
    connectionId: string,
    playerID: string,
    name: string,
    role: string, // "A"
    wealth: Array<number>, //starts as [0]
    rank: Array<number>, //starts as [0]
    planet: string, //`${planetID},${planetName}`,
    taxRate: Array<number>, // ONLY A | starts as [defaultRate]
    redistributedWealth: Array<number>, // ONLY A | amount they redistributed to B and C players in a round
    playerCount: Array<number>, // ONLY A | number of players on the planet they are currently on
    bankrupt: Array<boolean>, // - true if they went bankrupt in a round
}
```

#### Role B
```javascript
`${gameID}---${playerID}`: {
    connectionId: string,
    playerID: string,
    name: string,
    role: string, // "B"
    wealth: Array<number>, //starts as [0]
    rank: Array<number>, //starts as [0]
    planet: `${planetID},${planetName}`,
    income: Array<number>, // - income they recieve in a round
    declaredIncome: Array<number>, // - income they declared in a round
    audit: Array<number>, // - amount they were fined in an audit in a round
    bankrupt: Array<boolean>, // - true if their planet went bankrupt in a round
}
```

#### Role C
```javascript
${gameID}---${playerID}: {
    connectionId: string,
    playerID: string,
    name: string,
    role: string, // "C"
    wealth: Array<number>,
    rank: Array<number>,
    planet: Array<string>, //only an array for role C [`${planetID},${planetName}`]
    income: Array<number>, // - income they recieve in a round
    declaredIncome: Array<number>, // - income they declared in a round
    audit: Array<number>, // - amount they were fined in an audit in a round
    bankrupt: Array<boolean>, // - true if they went bankrupt in a round
}
```

#### Returns
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `{"type":"joinGame","message":{"options":{"stageTime":20,"auditChance":0.1,"finePercent":0.5,"planetCollectionMultiplier":1.7,"taxRate":0.3,"declaredIncomePercent":0,"incomeMax":1200,"incomeMin":600,"bankruptcyThreshold":0,"generateNewIncomeEachRound":false}}}`
```

> Each time a player sends a joinGame request, the host will receive the following string: `{"type":"startGame","message":[{"planetID":"planet1","planetName":"Terralus","players":[{"connectionID":"ZqGUhc8pliACFpw=","playerID":"00001","playerName":"Emma","role":"A"},{"connectionID":"ZqGWHc1-FiACETQ=","playerID":"00002","playerName":"Jules","role":"B"},{"connectionID":"ZqGXndKyFiACEXA=","playerID":"00003","playerName":"Stevie","role":"C"}]}]}`

### ~~Existing Connection~~ DEPRECIATED
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: "{\"connectionId\":\"Zg2C4e7uliACEsg= \",\"playerID\":\"00001 \",\"name\":\"Emma \",\"role\":\"A\",\"wealth\":[0],\"rank\":[0],\"planet\":\"planet1,Quintaris\",\"taxRate\":[],\"redistributedWealth\":[],\"playerCount\":[],\"bankrupt\":[]}"
```

## startGame
startGame goes through all of the planets in the elasticache-tax-game cache, ensures that there are no planets with an awkward amount of players (checks the last planet), and then sends each player their planet (name and ID) and role.

* If there are two or less players, startGame reassigns each of them to an existing planet with the "B" role
    * The existing planets are determined by the player's position in the player array: `planetsObject[newestPlanet.players.indexOf(player)].players.push`

### Required data
```javascript
action: string, //MUST BE "game"
type: string, //MUST BE "startGame"
gameID: string
```

### Each player receives:
The players array **includes** this player
`{"type":"startGame","message":{{"planetID":"planet1","planetName":"Soralia","playerRole":"C","players":["Emma","Jules","Steve","Thomas","Kelvin","Dana"]}}`

## startRound
It should be sent by the **Host**. Creates an array of items in `DynamoDBStack-WebsocketConnections87C62C57-1H8H09K1YWXHY` with the given gameID, and then sends each connection the response message.

### Required data
```javascript
action: string, //MUST BE "game",
type: string, //MUST BE "startRound"
gameID: string,
round: number
```

### Returns
#### To Host
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `{"type":"startRound","message":{{"round":1,"stage":1,"stageStartTime":"2024-06-17T18:17:49.544Z","stageDuration":20}}`
```

#### To Players
```javascript
    statusCode: 200,
    body: `{"type":"startRound","message":{"round":1,"stage":1,"stageStartTime":"2024-06-17T17:48:58.380Z","stageDuration":20}}`
```

## stageChanges, handleStage, & startStage
* `stageChanges` is sent by a player that needed to make an action during that stage:
    - At the end of stage 1, all "A" players should send a `stageChanges` request
    - At the end of stage 2, all "B" and "C" players should send a `stageChanges` request
    - At the end of stage 3, **all** players should send a `stageChanges` request
    - At the end of stage 4, "C" players should send a `stageChanges` request
* `handleStage` should be sent by the **Host** when the stage is up (stageDuration has elapsed). All players will be alerted that they must send their `stageChanges` request
    - This way, only one system is managing the time, and the WebSockets aren't using up a massive amount of processing power while each connection waits for stageDuration to elapse before sending a response.

<Warning>The WebSockets don't check if the stage duration is up. The response to `stageChanges` is sent in `handleStage`.</Warning>

<Warning>If players don't make a change, the request they send **needs** to have the default values in it. WebSockets will apply the logic to what is sent (so if the player sends 0, it will use 0 as the value), or send a `401 BAD REQUEST` if it's missing</Warning>
