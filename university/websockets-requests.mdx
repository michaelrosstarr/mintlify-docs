## createGame
createGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `game`. It also creates the first empty planet in the planets array (in the elasticache-tax-game cache with the key `planets`).

### Required data
```
action: "game",
type: "createGame",
gameID: [from POST /createGame] //string
stageTime: [from client] //in seconds (eg: 20 = 20s | so a round will be 1m 20s)
auditChance: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
finePercent: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
pcm: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 1.7) | planet collection multiplier
defaultRate: [from client] //number, decimal (eg: 20% = 0.20)
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"createGame","gameID":"game-c3b4i7ybc","stageTime":20,"auditChance":0.25,"finePercent":0.15,"pcm":1.7,"defaultRate":0.30}`

### Result
```
game: {
    hostID: connectionID,
    gameID: data.gameID,
    gameConfiguration: {
    stageTime: data.stageTime,
    auditChance: data.auditChance,
    finePercent: data.finePercent,
    pcm: data.pcm,
    defaultRate: data.defaultRate,
  }
}

planets :[
  {
      planetID: "planet0",
      name: "planet0",
      players: [],
  },
]
```

## joinGame
joinGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `${gameID}---${playerID}`. It will return a generated role and planet to each connection (once the planet is established), and update the host with the new player (playerID and name).

### Required data
```
action: "game",
type: "joinGame",
gameID: [from client] //string
playerID: [from POST /joinGame] //string
name: [from client] //string
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"joinGame","gameID":"game-c3b4i7ybc","playerID":"001a","name":"Destiel"}`

### Result

#### Role A
```
game-c3b4i7ybc---001a: {
    connectionId: connectionID,
    playerID: data.playerID,
    name: data.name,
    role: "A", //
    wealth: [0],
    rank: [0],
    planet: `${planetAndRoleObj.planet}`,
    taxRate: [], // ONLY A
    redistributedWealth: [], // ONLY A | amount they redistributed to B and C players in a round
    playerCount: [], // ONLY A | number of players on the planet they are currently on (relevant for redistribution calculations & planet stats)
    bankrupt: [], // - true if they went bankrupt in a round
}
```
