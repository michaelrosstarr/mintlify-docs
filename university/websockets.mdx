[Working with WebSocket APIs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api.html)

The websocket has 3 built in routes. Each of them needs some functionality as listed below.

1. `$connect`
2. `$disconnect`
3. `$default`

## $connect

There are two states that connect can be in. First time connect and reconnecting. Other info is that each time a user connects to the web socket server, even if they are returning, they are issued with a new connection ID. This connection ID can be read from `event.requestContext.connectionId`.

### First Time Connecting

If this is the first time that a player is connecting to the web socket server. You will need to save their connection ID in the connections table, see [here](/university/database#connection-table).

### Reconnecting

If for whatever reason, a user is disconnected, they should be given an oppotunity to reconnect. We may need to create an additional route that is called if a game and player ID is stored on the frontend to see if it is valid. If it is valid, update the connections table with the updated connection ID. Maybe something like the currently implemented `check` function, where we pass through the player and game ID and see if it exsits in the current connections table.

We also need to keep some stuff persistent, especially like what current stage of the game we are on and if we are in the game loop, what current round we are on.

## $disconnect

This is triggered when a player disconnects from the web socket server. As it stands now, it just returns some random data, but we might want to handle it differently?

## $default

Honestly, I have no idea what this route does. I think it is a fallback route. So that if something does not match any other route, it default to this one.

## Logging

Something that would be a nice to have would be logging connects and disconnects. It can be just in a DynamoDB table. If we need to extend the DynamoDB configuration, we can do that. This would be a nice QOL thing to have.

## WebSocket requests
This is an explanation of the data that needs to be sent to the WebSocket connection to execute a given function. For each function, you can find the data structure and an example of a working command.

### createGame
CreateGame creates an object in the elasticache-tax-game cache, with the key `game`. It also creates the first empty planet in the planets array (in the elasticache-tax-game cache with the key `planets`).

#### Required data:
```
action: "game",
type: "createGame",
gameID: string, from RestAPI
stageTime: in seconds (eg: 20 = 20s | so a round will be 1m 20s)
auditChance: number, decimal
finePercent: number, decimal
pcm: number, decimal | planet collection multiplier
defaultRate: number, decimal
```

example: `{"action":"game","type":"createGame","gameID":"game-c3b4i7ybc","stageTime":20,"auditChance":0.25,"finePercent":0.15,"pcm":1.7,"defaultRate":0.30}`

#### Result in elasticache-tax-game:
```
game: {
    hostID: connectionID,
    gameID: data.gameID,
    gameConfiguration: {
    stageTime: data.stageTime,
    auditChance: data.auditChance,
    finePercent: data.finePercent,
    pcm: data.pcm,
    defaultRate: data.defaultRate,
  }
}

planets :[
  {
      planetID: "planet0",
      name: "planet0",
      players: [],
  },
]
```
