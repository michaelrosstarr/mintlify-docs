## API

The API is using a framework called Hono, which allows for easy serverless development. Configuration of Hono is not required, and you simply just need to go and add your routes in `server/lambda/index.ts`. It is very similar to Express just with more support for serverless.

```ts server/lambda/index.ts
app.post('/createGame', async (c) => {

    const gameId = generateRandomPIN();
    const TABLE_NAME = "TABLE_NAME_GOES_HERE";

    const putParams = {
        TableName: TABLE_NAME,
        Item: {
            gameID: gameId
        },
    };

    try {
        await ddb.put(putParams).promise();
    } catch (err) {
        return c.json({ success: false, error: "Failed to connect: " + JSON.stringify(err) }, 500)
    }

    return c.json({ success: 'true', gameId: gameId })
})
```

You can interact with any of the AWS services by just using `AWS` object. We are using AWS CDK, which allows for easy serverless development, the API reference documentation can be found [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/api/v2/docs/aws-construct-library.html).
