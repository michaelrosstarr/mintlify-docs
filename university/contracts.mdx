}
```

**Response**

Status Code: `200 OK`

```js

```

**Web Socket**

If the request was successful, the client will need to make the following websocket request:
```js
{
    action: "game",
    data: {
        type: "joinGame",
        gameID: GameID,
        playerID: PlayerID
    }
}
```

This will then linked the player ID, socket ID and game ID in the connections database.

# Start Game

This will be used by the game host to start a game.

**Web Socket**

The following websocket request will need to be made:

```js
{
    action: "game",
    data: {
        type: "startGame",
        gameID: GameID
    }
}
```

This will then go through the connection table, getting all of the connection ID's for the provided game ID. It will then broadcast a message out to all those clients saying that the game is about to start.

# Start of Round

The timing will be managed by the host.

**Web Socket**

```js
{
    action: "game",
    data: {
        type: "startRound",
        round: RoundNumber,
        startTime: StartTime,
        endTime: EndTime
    }
}
```
